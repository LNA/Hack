# Hack

Projects I've Worked on at Chicago Ruby Hack Night

## How I Build Things
* I alwalys try to pair with a beginner.  Personally, teaching is the best way to learn.
* We test drive the application.
* We start with the high level details and work out way down.
* We implement basic design patters, idiomatic Ruby, and best practices.

## Run
* cd into the directory
* type ruby main.rb into your command line

## Testing
* rspec spec

## Requirements

* Ruby  2.0.0
* Rspec 3.0.2
* Pry   0.10.0
